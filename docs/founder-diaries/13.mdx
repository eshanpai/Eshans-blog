One of the hardest things I’ve faced as a founder is balancing the startup grind with personal life. It’s easy to get consumed by work, but I’ve learned that without taking care of myself, the business can’t thrive either.


<h1>Finding Balance</h1>
I’ve made it a priority to block time for personal health, relationships, and hobbies. It’s not always easy, but it’s essential. A healthy founder is a productive founder, and that balance helps you show up as your best self for your business and your team.
