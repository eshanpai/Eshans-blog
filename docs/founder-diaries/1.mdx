It wasn’t the tech.
It wasn’t the funding.
It wasn’t the fear of failing.

The hardest part?
Deciding that this idea was worth betting my life on.

Before Strayapay had a name,
before a single QR code was printed,
before I knew who’d build the backend or if anyone would even care —
there was just one question looping in my head:

“Why hasn’t anyone in Australia fixed this yet?”

I saw small businesses getting slugged 2% on every tap.
I saw merchants shrug and say, “That’s just how it is.”
I saw trust in local payments eroding — silently.

And still… I hesitated.
Because once you say “I’m building this”,
you can't un-say it.

But once I did,
the anxiety turned into action.
The late nights turned into working screens.
The rejections? They became rehearsals.

Strayapay isn’t just a product.
It’s the first time I stopped waiting for someone else to solve it —
and decided maybe that someone’s me.
