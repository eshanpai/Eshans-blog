One of the hardest lessons I’ve learned is that perfection is a trap. As a founder, it’s easy to want everything to be perfect before launching, but sometimes, you just have to get started.



<h1>Progress Over Perfection</h1>
I spent too much time polishing every detail. Eventually, I realized that perfection isn’t what drives growth. It’s progress. Launch, learn, iterate — that’s how you build momentum. Perfection comes with time, but action is what leads to progress.
