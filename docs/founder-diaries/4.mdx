Trust isn’t something you can demand; it’s something you build, brick by brick. As a founder, your relationship with customers, partners, and even employees, is based on trust. I realized early that authenticity and transparency are the best way to build it.



<h1>Customer Relationships</h1>
From day one, I’ve learned that people can see through fake promises. The best way to earn trust is to overdeliver. Even if you don’t have all the answers yet, always be honest and communicate openly with your audience. Trust is built in the long term, not overnight.
