I thought about this as soon as I landed in Australia. Paying a surcharge for a meal delivery — even after groceries were bought — made me realize how much money could be saved by just understanding where it’s going. The rush of taking the first step, and the realization of how small decisions are pivotal, especially when you're starting from scratch in a new market.
