I thought about this as soon as I landed in Australia. Paying a surcharge for a meal delivery — even after groceries were bought — made me realize how much money could be saved by just understanding where it’s going. The rush of taking the first step, and the realization of how small decisions are pivotal, especially when you're starting from scratch in a new market.




<h1>The Surcharge Moment</h1>
That surcharge wasn’t just an extra cost; it became a wake-up call. Every dollar counts when you’re bootstrapping, and those small costs add up fast. The first takeaway? Find a way to optimize cash flow, track every penny, and make every transaction meaningful.
