One thing that every founder eventually learns is that uncertainty is inevitable. There are no guarantees in this journey, and that’s what makes it so unpredictable and exciting.



<h1>The Unknown is Your Playground</h1>
The key is not to be paralyzed by the unknown but to embrace it. I’ve stopped trying to predict every outcome. Instead, I focus on preparing for every scenario and remain agile enough to adapt. Uncertainty is where innovation happens, and where the most interesting opportunities emerge.
