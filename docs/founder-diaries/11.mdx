One of the best pieces of advice I got early on was to network relentlessly. It’s easy to think of it as just exchanging business cards, but it’s much more about building genuine relationships that can add value in unexpected ways.




<h1>Networking is a Skill</h1>
I didn’t realize how important networking was until I started building a strong network of mentors, advisors, and peers. Not only has it opened doors for new opportunities, but it’s also provided valuable advice and feedback that’s helped guide the business in the right direction.
