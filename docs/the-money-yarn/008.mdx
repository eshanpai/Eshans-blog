The Money Yarn — This Week in Aussie & Indian Fintech
 Pull up a chair. It’s time to untangle what happened in the world of finance, founders, and fearless pivots.
 ⸻
**Australia:**
 RBA holds rates, again: Inflation’s not quite tamed, but the RBA is playing it safe. It’s a “hold and hope” strategy — and everyone from mortgage brokers to crypto bros is watching.

Zepto hits 1 billion in processed payments: The Aussie PayTo-native startup just passed a big milestone. While others were chasing points and plastic, Zepto quietly bet on the pipes.

Afterpay co-founder returns to fintech: Word is out — Nick Molnar’s next act involves a stealth payments project. Once a BNPL king, always a fintech cowboy.
⸻

**India:**
 NPCI greenlights international UPI use: You can now use UPI abroad — starting with a few UAE and Singapore merchants. India’s turning its domestic rails into global infrastructure.

PhonePe launches Point-of-Sale device: India’s most downloaded payments app is going physical — card + UPI + QR in one sleek box. Paytm, your move.

Zerodha’s new mutual fund platform goes live: Passive investing just got a homegrown facelift. Expect nudges, no jargons, and maybe fewer uncles chasing stock tips on WhatsApp.
⸻
🎯 **Bonus Byte:**
 Visa experimenting with offline CBDC payments: In a pilot with the RBI, Visa's testing tap-to-pay CBDC cards that don’t need internet. Imagine digital cash that works when your WiFi doesn’t.

Meanwhile, in a Brunswick coworking space, a young founder’s mum still thinks he sells coffee machines — not code that might power the next payment revolution.
⸻

 Whether you’re fixing onboarding flows at 2am or just trying to decode term sheets with your co-founder, remember:
 Money talks. But The Yarn always spills the tea.
Catch ya next Sunday.
