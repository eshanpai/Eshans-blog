The Money Yarn — This Week in Aussie & Indian Fintech
 Pull up a chair. It’s time to untangle what happened in the world of finance, founders, and fearless pivots.
⸻
**Australia:**
 Commonwealth Bank cracks down on crypto: CBA is now blocking certain crypto payments and exchanges, citing fraud risks. Banks aren’t just gatekeepers — they’re bouncers now.

 Afterpay exits in-store: Block is quietly phasing out in-store Afterpay cards. BNPL is morphing again — the flashy phase is over; only fundamentals remain.

 RBA floats CBDC trials: The Reserve Bank’s digital dollar pilot is back in talks. It’s early — but the message is clear: cash is dying, and programmable money isn’t sci-fi anymore.
⸻
**India:**
 Zerodha’s new tax tool: India’s top stock broker launched a capital gains tax planner ahead of filing season. Fintech is officially doing the CA’s job now — and doing it better.

 Ola shuts down fintech arm: Ola Money is being axed as Bhavish Aggarwal focuses on EVs and AI. Classic India pivot: “Forget payments — let’s build batteries and LLMs.

 NPCI launches voice payments: Now you can speak into your phone and pay via UPI. From “scan” to “say and pay” — India is testing every layer of UX possible.
⸻
 🎯 **Bonus Byte**:
 Visa just dropped an API for CBDC settlements.
 
 Yup — the same Visa that’s getting squeezed by PayTo in Australia and UPI in India is now joining the party.
 
 You either disrupt the rails or lay down new ones.
Meanwhile, in dorm rooms and Discord chats, someone’s trying to build the next PayPal — with nothing but Figma, Firebase, and a dream.
⸻
 Whether you're debugging a QR scanner or pitching to a sleepy angel investor, remember:
 Money moves fast — but good stories move faster.

Catch ya next Sunday.
