The Money Yarn â€” This Week in Aussie & Indian Fintech
Pull up a chair. Hereâ€™s what went down in the world of startups, bills, and big money moves.

**Australia**
Xero bumps up prices again â€” and users are just copping it.
 The accounting giant raised fees (again), but barely anyoneâ€™s switching. Why? Moving your books is harder than moving house. Lesson: build a product thatâ€™s so sticky, itâ€™s easier to pay more than start fresh.

Afterpay and Zip hit the brakes.
 User growth has slowed, margins are thinning, and BNPL fatigue is real. Regulators are circling, and big BNPL is starting to feel... old. But the idea? Still gold â€” if done right and in the right niche.

Airwallex crossed $100 billion in volume â€” and hardly made a fuss.
 Started by four Melburnians, now quietly one of the worldâ€™s biggest payment companies. No gimmicks, just clean product and B2B focus. A reminder that the best fintechs sometimes grow quietly behind the scenes.


**India**
BharatPe is handing out SME loans using QR code data.
 Theyâ€™re turning real-time UPI payments into credit signals â€” no paperwork, no middlemen. Imagine walking into a kirana store, scanning a QR code, and building your credit just by running your biz.

Paytmâ€™s under more RBI heat â€” and itâ€™s looking messy.
 Indiaâ€™s most famous fintech is facing tighter restrictions after ongoing compliance issues. Wallets, savings, and trust are all on pause. If fintech is a game, compliance is the umpire â€” and Paytmâ€™s getting carded.

Zepto raised $400M â€” still delivering bananas in 10 mins.
 Quick commerce is still a VC darling. But the real question is: will anyone care if your paneer gets there in 11 minutes instead of 9? Itâ€™s a speed game â€” but whereâ€™s the margin?

ðŸ§  **The Wrap**
This weekâ€™s vibe?
 The giants are slowing down, the quiet ones are scaling up, and regulators are cracking knuckles on both sides of the globe.
Founders that play smart, stay lean, and keep it real?
 They're the ones who'll outlast the hype.
Thatâ€™s your yarn for the week. What stood out to you? ðŸ‘‡
