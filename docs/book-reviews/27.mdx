Most startup books are written for founders. This one’s for **investors** — or anyone thinking about becoming one.
Jason Calacanis has made millions backing early-stage startups like Uber, Calm, and Robinhood. He doesn’t just explain how he did it — he teaches you how to **think like an angel investor**, even with $1k in the bank.

💡 **What It Taught Me**:
•	The goal is to find 1 in 100 that becomes a 100x — not play it safe.
•	Great founders have 2 things: **insight and obsession**.
•	The most important skill? Saying no 99% of the time.

❤️ **What I Enjoyed**:
•	Fast, bold, and conversational — feels like a long coffee chat.
•	Offers a real look into the messy early stages of investing.
•	Good founder insights too — reverse-engineered from what investors look for.

🤔 **What's Loud**:
•	Calacanis has a big personality — some readers may find it too self-promotional.
•	U.S.-centric view — adapt for other markets.

📈 **Verdict**:
If you’ve ever thought, *“I wish I got in early on [startup],”* — this is your playbook.
Even better if you're a founder who wants to understand the investor mindset.

**Rating**: **4.5/5**
