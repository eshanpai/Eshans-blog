If The Lean Startup told you to test, Lean Analytics shows you **exactly what to measure** — and when.
This book is a goldmine if you’re building a startup and unsure what “traction” really looks like. It outlines **one metric that matters** at each stage — from empathy, to stickiness, to growth, to revenue.

💡 **Insights That Stick**:
•	You can’t optimize what you haven’t validated.
•	Don’t get distracted by vanity metrics — focus on **actionable metrics** tied to decisions.
•	Know your archetype (marketplace, SaaS, content, etc.) — metrics vary.

❤️ **What I Found Useful**:
•	Clear frameworks: Pirate Metrics (AARRR), stage-based analytics, and cohort tracking.
•	Real startup examples with charts, not just theory.
•	Super practical if you're pre–product-market fit.

🤔 **What Slowed Me**:
•	Very data-heavy — not a casual weekend read.
•	Some parts may feel outdated for new channels like TikTok or Web3.

📈 **Verdict**:
Read this before you run another growth experiment.
It’ll help you see through the noise and focus on what actually matters.

**Rating**: **4.6/5**
