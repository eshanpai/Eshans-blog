Most books tell you to save more. This one tells you to **spend smarter** — before it’s too late.
Bill Perkins argues that you should maximise life experiences, not your bank balance. And that dying with a massive net worth is, in his words, “wasted potential.”

💡 **Key Reframes**:
•	Spend when you can enjoy it most — not just when you’re older.
•	Track “memory dividends” — the return on experiences, not just assets.
•	Avoid over-saving out of fear or inertia.

❤️ **What I Appreciated**:
•	It pushed me to consider when I want to spend — not just how much.
•	Great if you’re scared of spending or stuck in save-hoard-repeat.
•	The charts and lifecycle examples are weirdly comforting.

🤔 **What I Questioned**:
•	It assumes predictable life paths — not always realistic for freelancers or founders.
•	You still need discipline — or you risk justifying reckless spending.

📈 **Verdict**:
A bold, sometimes uncomfortable read — but important.
Especially if you’re great at earning and terrible at living.

**Rating**: **4.3/5**
