In a world obsessed with specialisation, *Range* makes a counter-argument: **generalists win.**
Epstein compares chess prodigies to late-blooming Nobel laureates, Tiger Woods to Roger Federer — showing that sampling widely often leads to deeper success.


💡 **Key Ideas**:
•	Early specialisation can lead to burnout and tunnel vision.
•	“Sampling periods” in careers lead to better decision-making.
•	Innovation often comes from people who cross domains.

❤️ **What I Liked**:
•	Gave me permission to feel proud of a non-linear journey.
•	Case studies are fascinating and well told.
•	Encouraging for people figuring things out in their 30s or later.

🤔 **What Didn't Land**:
•	The argument can feel repetitive.
•	Not prescriptive — more a mindset shift than a how-to.

📈 **Verdict**:
If you’ve ever felt behind because you weren’t a “child prodigy” — read this.

**Rating**: **4.6/5**
