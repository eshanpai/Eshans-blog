Yes, I saved this one for last — because it still hits home even after all the others.
*The Lean Startup* doesn’t promise a shortcut. It promises a **feedback loop**.
Build. Measure. Learn. That’s the gospel — and honestly, it’s still the most powerful framework in startup land.

💡 **Key Frameworks**:
•	MVP (Minimum Viable Product) — not perfect, just testable.
•	Validated learning — your ego doesn’t count as data.
•	Innovation accounting — track progress, not just code pushes.

❤️ **What I Still Use**:
•	It gave language to what I was already feeling: launch before you’re ready.
•	“Pivot or persevere” is still the toughest — and most useful — question.
•	Makes failure feel less fatal, more iterative.

🤔 **What's Aged**:
•	Some examples (Dropbox, IMVU) feel like tech relics.
•	Doesn’t address the marketing/growth side enough.

📈 **Verdict**:
The one that started it all.
Still useful. Still humbling. Still worth your time.

**Rating**: **4.7/5**
