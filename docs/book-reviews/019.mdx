This isn’t a light read — but it’s one of the most important.
The book explores a bold theory: that the wealth of nations depends not on culture, geography, or luck — but on **inclusive institutions**. In other words, power that’s shared, not hoarded.

💡 **Core Thesis**:
•	Inclusive political and economic systems drive prosperity.
•	Extractive systems — where power and wealth are concentrated — eventually collapse.
•	History isn’t a straight line. Progress isn’t guaranteed.

❤️ **What Worked For Me**:
•	Detailed examples — from the Congo to Korea to colonial America.
•	Challenges lazy arguments about “lazy cultures” or bad weather.
•	Gave me a new lens for reading the news.

🤔 **What's Tough**:
•	Long. 500+ pages of academic prose.
•	The tone is repetitive at times.

📈 **Verdict**:
If you care about policy, global inequality, or startup ecosystems — this is essential context

**Rating**: **4.6/5**
