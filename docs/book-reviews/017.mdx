This book doesn't teach you how to survive chaos — it teaches you how to **benefit** from it.
Taleb’s writing is chaotic, cocky, and occasionally hard to follow — but beneath the noise is a powerful insight: some systems (and people) **get stronger when stressed**. Not just resilient. **Antifragile.**

💡 **Big Ideas**:
•	Antifragility is more than robustness — it’s the ability to **thrive** under volatility.
•	Don’t try to predict the future. **Build for randomness.**
•	Decentralisation, redundancy, and skin in the game are key ingredients.

❤️ **What I Admired**:
•	Challenges conventional thinking — especially around risk, control, and institutions.
•	Made me see fragility in places I never considered (corporate jobs, central banks, even health routines).
•	The barbell strategy is genius: extreme safety on one end, bold bets on the other.

🤔 **What Made Me Pause**:
•	Taleb’s tone is abrasive — he insults readers, critics, and entire professions.
•	The book meanders. A lot.

📈 **Verdict**:
Read this slowly. Argue with it. Highlight it. It’ll frustrate you — and you’ll still walk away sharper.

**Rating**: **4.4/5**
