The investing bible. Dense, heavy, but filled with timeless wisdom.
Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett’s mentor, wrote this in 1949 — and yet its ideas about value, margin of safety, and market psychology remain eerily relevant.

💡 **Key Principles**:
•	Separate price from value — Mr. Market is emotional.
•	Invest with a margin of safety, always.
•	Focus on long-term fundamentals, not short-term noise.

❤️ **What’s Worth It**:
•	Teaches patience and discipline — two things most investors lack.
•	The commentary by Jason Zweig adds modern context.
•	Reinforces that boring investing often beats brilliant gambles.

🤔 **What’s Tough**:
•	It’s long. And not exactly fun.
•	Some chapters feel like homework.

📈 **Verdict**:
Not for casual readers — but if you want to truly understand investing at a foundational level, this is it.

**Rating**: **4.4/5**
