This book is the opposite of influencer finance. No Lambos. No flashy houses. Just data — and a quiet truth:
Most millionaires look nothing like what you’d expect.
They drive used cars. Live in modest homes. Spend less than they earn. And most importantly, they **prioritise financial independence over status.**


💡 **Key ideas**:
•	High income ≠ high net worth.
•	Wealthy people often **avoid status symbols** because they focus on assets, not appearances.
•	Economic self-discipline is more common in first-generation wealth than inherited wealth.

❤️ **What I Liked**:
•	It felt like a secret handbook for long-term wealth.
•	Research-backed — this isn’t opinion, it’s survey data across decades.
•	It de-glamorises wealth in the best way.

🤔 **What Fell Flat**:
•	Written in the 90s — so some references are outdated.
•	Case studies feel repetitive after a while.

📈 **Final Verdict**:
This isn’t an exciting read. But it’s an essential one.
If you want to be rich and *stay rich*, this is your blueprint.

**Rating**: **4.5/5**
