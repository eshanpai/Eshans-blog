This is creativity therapy. Short, punchy, and packed with permission to stop waiting and start making.
Kleon argues that original work isn’t created in a vacuum — it’s built by remixing, rethinking, and **stealing intelligently** from the people who came before you.
If you’ve ever felt unoriginal or “not creative enough,” this is your antidote.

💡 **Core Takeaways**:
•	Nothing is truly original — creativity is a form of **curated theft.**
•	Side projects, hobbies, and boredom are creative fuel.
•	Make stuff you wish existed — even if no one’s watching.

❤️ **What I Loved**:
•	It made me want to create something immediately.
•	Visually engaging — full of quotes, sketches, and white space.
•	Doesn’t romanticise the creative process — just demystifies it.

🤔 **What's Lacking**:
•	It’s a 1-hour read — you’ll wish it was longer.
•	Less strategy, more mindset.

📈 **Verdict**:
A creative reset for anyone stuck in their head.
Read it when you feel like an imposter.

**Rating**: **4.6/5**
