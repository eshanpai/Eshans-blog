This book made me pause mid-scroll.
Dr. Anna Lembke, a Stanford psychiatrist, explores why we’re addicted — not just to substances, but to **everything that feels good for a second and terrible after.** Instagram. Food. Porn. Even productivity.
She explains that **dopamine** — the brain’s feel-good chemical — isn’t bad. But we’re living in a world engineered to overstimulate it, constantly. The result? A weird cocktail of anxiety, burnout, and numbness.

💡 **Takeaways**:
•	Pleasure and pain exist on the same neurological scale — chase one too hard, and the brain overcorrects with the other.
•	The best treatment for overindulgence? **Radical abstinence**, even for a short time. Give your brain a reset.
•	Addiction isn’t rare. It’s just become normalised.

❤️ **What I Loved**:
•	Raw patient stories that stick with you — including her own struggle with romance novels.
•	It made me reconsider *what I reach for when I’m bored* — and why that matters.
•	Practical detox tips that don’t feel preachy.

🤔 **What Didn’t Click**:
•	If you’ve never experienced compulsion or addiction, some ideas might feel extreme.
•	The clinical tone softens in parts, but it’s still academic at heart.

📈 **Final Verdict**:
If your phone is your first instinct in the morning — read this.
It won’t scold you. But it will show you the cost of constant pleasure.

**Rating**: **4.7/5**
