This one’s a modern classic in startup circles — and for good reason.
Peter Thiel doesn’t give you a startup checklist. He gives you a **philosophy** — about monopolies, contrarian thinking, and creating something truly new. *Zero to One* is about building companies that leap forward, not just improve on what exists.


💡 **Big Shifts**:
•	Competition is for losers. Aim to **escape competition** through innovation.
•	The best startups begin with secrets — truths others overlook.
•	Founders should aim for monopoly economics — not marginal gains.

❤️ **What Stuck With Me**:
•	Clean mental models: definite vs. indefinite optimism, vertical vs. horizontal growth.
•	Pushed me to question what “differentiation” actually means.
•	Doesn’t try to be universally applicable — it’s unapologetically specific.

🤔 **What's Limiting**:
•	The tone is very Thiel — bold, at times polarising.
•	It downplays execution in favour of ideology.

📈 **Verdict**:
This isn’t a how-to. It’s a what-to-believe.
If you want to build something rare, start here.

**Rating**: **4.7/5**
