Scott Kupor runs operations at Andreessen Horowitz, so this book isn’t speculative — it’s from **inside the deal flow.**
He explains how venture capital really works: the fund structure, how partners think, and why “no” often means “maybe later.”

💡 **What I Took Away**:
•	VCs raise money too — from LPs. Understanding their incentives explains their behavior.
•	Board seats aren’t just a checkbox — they shift power.
•	A $5M raise isn’t free. It sets your next milestone. Be ready.

❤️ **What's Strong**:
•	The clearest explanation I’ve read of how VC math works.
•	Helps you prep for the long game, not just the next pitch.
•	Strong founder–investor alignment advice.

🤔 **What's Niche**:
•	U.S.–centric structure (Delaware C-corps, etc.).
•	May feel heavy if you’re not actively raising.

📈 **Verdict**:
This is the “How Funding Works 101” you don’t get on LinkedIn.
Vital reading before your first board meeting.

**Rating**: **4.5/5**
