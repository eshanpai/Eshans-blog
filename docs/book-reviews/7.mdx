This book felt like reading the operator’s manual for a billionaire’s brain.
Ray Dalio doesn’t just share business lessons — he gives you the operating system he used to build Bridgewater, one of the most successful hedge funds in history.
It’s dense. It’s deliberate. And honestly, not always easy to get through.
But if you stick with it, it rewards you with **mental models** that don’t just apply to finance — they apply to how you deal with failure, feedback, and your own blind spots.


💡 **Core Ideas That Stuck**:
•	**“Pain + reflection = progress.”** 
It’s not the failure that teaches you — it’s how long you spend looking it in the eye afterward.
•	**Radical transparency:** Say the thing. Hear the thing. Avoid the politics.
•	**Write down your principles.** So when chaos hits, your values aren’t up for debate.
•	**Believability-weighted decision-making:** Don’t just vote — weight opinions based on expertise.

⚖️ **What I Liked**:
•	It’s part autobiography, part leadership manual — you get the story and the system.
•	Dalio includes real memos, charts, and decision trees — not just ideas, but how he operationalised them.
•	The book forces you to confront your own thinking patterns — and sharpen them.

🤔 **What’s Not For Everyone:**:
•	It’s long. Like really long. Some parts read like internal company docs.
•	The tone can feel a bit rigid — Dalio’s system is his world, and he treats it like gospel.
•	If you’re early in your career, it might feel overwhelming. This book is more of a toolkit than a pep talk.

📈 **Final Verdict**:
Principles isn’t a page-turner. It’s a mirror.
It helps you understand why you make decisions the way you do — and whether those decisions are working.
Read it with a pen.
You’ll come out the other side thinking clearer, not just bigger.

**Rating**: **4.6/5**
