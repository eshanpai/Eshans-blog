This isn’t a motivational book. It’s an unmotivational one — and that’s why it works.
Mark Manson argues that life is suffering, everyone sucks at something, and we all have a limited number of f*cks to give — so **choose wisely**.

💡 **Hard Truths**:
•	You can't be extraordinary at everything — and you shouldn’t try.
•	Growth comes from solving better problems, not avoiding them.
•	Don’t aim for “happiness.” Aim for meaning.

❤️ **What’s Strong**:
•	Funny, but deep — in a punk rock kind of way.
•	Genuinely insightful reframes about failure, responsibility, and acceptance.
•	A great deconstruction of self-help culture.

🤔 **What’s Not For Everyone**:
•	The language is intentionally abrasive.
•	Some arguments feel too broad or anecdotal.

📈 **Verdict**:
A wake-up call disguised as a self-help book.
It won’t change your life overnight, but it’ll definitely shake your perspective.

**Rating**: **4.2/5**
