This is a buffet. A 600-page sampling of habits, tools, and weird rituals from some of the world’s most successful people — from athletes to investors to monks.
You’re not meant to read it cover-to-cover. Just open to any page and steal an idea.

💡 **What's Inside**:
•	Morning routines from Navy SEALs to CEOs
•	Fitness advice, book recommendations, and mental models
•	Questions that Ferriss asks every podcast guest

❤️ **What's Useful**:
•	No fluff — just dense, tactical notes.
•	Perfect for experimentation. Try one tool per week.
•	Makes success feel accessible. Like a system, not a myth.

🤔 **What's Not**:
•	Some quotes feel copy-pasted or surface-level.
•	If you’re looking for depth, this isn’t it.

📈 **Verdict**:
This is the productivity junkie’s playground.
Skim, borrow, tweak — and move on.

**Rating**: **4.5/5**
