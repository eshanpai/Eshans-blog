Gentle. Quiet. Thoughtful.
*Ikigai* explores the Japanese philosophy of living with purpose — a reason to get out of bed that combines what you love, what you’re good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.
It’s more lifestyle than self-help. Less “achieve,” more “align.”

💡 **What I Took Away**:
•	A slow, consistent life often beats a busy, goal-chasing one.
•	Diet, connection, movement, and mindset all fuel longevity.
•	Happiness often comes from flow, not outcomes.

❤️ **What's Beautiful**:
•	Evokes calm — like reading while sipping green tea.
•	Profiles of Okinawan centenarians add authenticity.
•	Made me rethink the pace of my daily life.

🤔 **What's Lacking**:
•	A bit surface-level for readers looking for depth or science.
•	Philosophical more than practical.

📈 **Verdict**:
Best read on a weekend morning, not during a hustle phase.
A warm reminder that your “why” doesn’t need to be loud to be powerful.

**Rating**: **4.4/5**
