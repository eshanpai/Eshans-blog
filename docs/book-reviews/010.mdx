What if you tracked every dollar you spent — not in rupees or dollars, but in **hours of your life?**
That’s what this book demands.
It’s not just about saving money. It’s about asking: *What is money costing me in time, energy, and meaning?*

💡 **Ideas That Hit Me**:
•	“Life energy” is your real currency — not cash.
•	You can reach *enough* — a place where work becomes optional, not mandatory.
•	Track your expenses religiously for a few months — it’s more transformative than budgeting.

❤️ **What Resonated**:
•	It’s not about guilt. It’s about **awareness**.
•	The tone is gentle but firm — like a wise friend asking questions you’ve been dodging.
•	Helped me rethink “retirement” as something you buy with discipline, not age.

🤔 **What Felt Dated**:
•	The book was written before online banking — some tracking methods feel manual.
•	Assumes you can earn and save consistently — which isn’t always realistic for everyone.

📈 **Final Verdict**:
One of the most philosophical finance books I’ve ever read.
Not for quick tips — but for deep rewiring.

**Rating**: **4.8/5**
