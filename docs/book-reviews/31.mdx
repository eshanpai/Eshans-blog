This is a playbook for solving one of the hardest problems in tech: **how to start a network effect business from scratch.**
Andrew Chen (partner at a16z, ex-Uber growth) goes deep into how products like Clubhouse, Airbnb, and Tinder overcame the "chicken-and-egg" problem — no users means no value... but no value means no users.

💡 **Network Effect Wisdom**:
•	Start small: **atomic networks** (e.g. a city, a group) are the seed.
•	Your power users will build your product if you give them tools.
•	Growth isn't linear — it's social, fragile, and contextual

❤️ **What Hit Home**:
•	Each case study (Slack, Zoom, Reddit) felt actionable, not just inspirational.
•	Clearly distinguishes different types of network effects (marketplace, data, viral).
•	Very relevant to fintech, creator tools, and platforms.

🤔 **What I'd Improve**:
•	Could’ve gone deeper into B2B SaaS or enterprise networks.
•	Some case studies gloss over failures or external market tailwinds.

📈 **Verdict**:
If your product gets better with more users — you need this book.
It’s strategy + psychology + growth, bundled neatly.

**Rating**: **4.7/5**
