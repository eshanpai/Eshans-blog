Most founders dread their board. This book helps you build one that **works with you**, not against you.
It covers how to recruit the right board members, run meetings that don’t suck, and avoid power struggles — especially when you’re pre-IPO or post-funding.

💡 **Practical Highlights**:
•	Don’t treat the board as an obligation — treat it as a **strategic lever.**
•	Set expectations early. Mismatched incentives ruin trust.
•	Diversity on a board = diversity in decisions.

❤️ **What Works**:
•	Tons of real-world scenarios, including horror stories.
•	Clarifies legal roles vs. practical influence.
•	Good for first-time CEOs and investor-backed companies.

🤔 **What's Technical**:
•	Some overlap with Venture Deals if you’ve read both.
•	A bit U.S.-centric in legal structure.

📈 **Verdict**:
If you have a board — or will soon — read this before your next quarterly.
It could save you from avoidable friction.

**Rating**: **4.5/5**
