If you live in Australia and haven’t read this, you’re either a genius or dangerously behind.
Scott Pape’s *Barefoot Investor* is the clearest, most practical money guide I’ve come across. Buckets. Fireproof files. Mojo accounts. It’s Aussie-flavoured, no-fluff advice — and it actually works.


💡 **Lessons I Still Use**:
•	Split your income into **buckets**: blow, grow, mojo, and more.
•	Schedule *monthly money dates* — like a check-in with your financial self.
•	Automate everything so you stop relying on willpower.

❤️ **What Works**:
•	Written for real people, not finance geeks.
•	It’s funny. Actually funny.
•	Works *especially well* for 20s/30s Australians navigating rent, Super, and side gigs.

🤔 **What Doesn’t Apply to All**:
•	Some advice (like bank recommendations) is outdated now.
•	Might feel basic if you already track your finances religiously

📈 **Final Verdict**:
The finance book I recommend to literally everyone.
It’s what a financial education should’ve looked like in school.

**Rating**: **5/5**
