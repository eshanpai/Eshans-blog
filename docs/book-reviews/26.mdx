This is **required reading** if you plan to raise money.
Feld and Mendelson break down how venture capital works — term sheets, dilution, board seats, liquidation preferences — all the confusing stuff you pretend to understand during investor calls.
It’s technical, but not dry. The authors use wit and clarity to make the startup-finance world less intimidating.

💡 **What It Taught Me**:
•	Not all valuations are equal — the fine print can make or break you.
•	The game is about leverage — and understanding how to keep it.
•	SAFE notes and convertible debt aren’t as “simple” as they look.

❤️ **What's Strong**:
•	Explains venture math with real scenarios.
•	Helps you protect yourself before you sign anything.
•	Up-to-date with modern deal terms and trends.

🤔 **What's Dense**:
•	Not a casual read — better if you’re actively raising or advising.
•	Legal-heavy sections may need a second read.

📈 **Verdict**:
Read this before your first investor meeting — and again after.
It won’t close the deal for you, but it might keep you from making a fatal mistake.

**Rating**: **4.6/5**
