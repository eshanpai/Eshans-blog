This book isn’t really a book — it’s a collection of thoughts. Tweets, blog posts, podcast bits, ideas scribbled into something coherent. Somehow, it works.
Naval doesn’t tell you how to get rich. He tells you how to think like someone who might.

And there’s a difference.
He says things that sound simple at first. Like:
“*Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you’ll be unstoppable.*”
At first, I nodded. Then I paused. Could I actually do either?
This wasn’t motivational — it was **confrontational** in a weirdly gentle way.

💡 **What Stuck With Me**:
•	**“Play long-term games with long-term people.”** That’s probably shaped half my decisions since.
•	**“Earn with your mind, not your time.”** This is the kind of line you reread quietly before quitting a job.
•	He reminds you that wealth isn’t about status. It’s about leverage, time, freedom, and calm.

⚖️ **What I Liked**:
•	It doesn’t feel polished. It feels… honest. Like a notebook you find, not a script you follow.
•	You can read it in pieces — no pressure to finish it in order.
•	It made me think slower, not faster. That’s rare in a world full of hustle noise.

🤔 **What I Struggled With**:
•	Some parts are vague — almost too minimal. You want more detail, but that’s not Naval’s style.
•	If you like structure, you’ll probably feel a bit lost here.

📈 **Final Verdict**:
This is the book you keep on your desk, not your shelf. You flip through it when you’re stuck, not when you’re bored.
Not everyone will love it — but if you’re building something of your own, it might just change your lens.

**Rating**: **4.7/5** — essential reading for humans with wallets.
