(Revisited and re-read)
Yes, I’ve reviewed this before. But reading it again —post a few hard weeks — it hit **very differently.**
This time, the chapter on “Reasonable > Rational” landed harder.
So did the idea that **wealth is what you don’t see** — and that being rich isn’t about income. It’s about restraint.

💡 **Fresh Notes**:
•	Wealth feels emotional — not just numerical.
•	You don’t need to optimize everything. Just avoid ruin.
•	Saving is the gap between ego and income.

📈 **Verdict(Second Read)**:
Even better the second time.
Timeless, gentle, and makes you feel like money doesn’t need to be complicated — it needs to be **understood**.
