This book isn’t new — but it’s still relevant.
When I finally picked up The Lean Startup, I wasn’t expecting anything groundbreaking. I’d seen the phrase thrown around in pitch decks and tech blogs for years. But reading it properly? Gave me a different kind of clarity.
Eric Ries doesn’t romanticise startups. He demystifies them.
What you get isn’t a magic formula — it’s a lens for how to think when you're building with limited time, limited cash, and zero guarantees.

💡 **What I Took Away**:
•	**“Build → Measure → Learn”** isn’t just a loop. It’s survival.
If you’re not testing, you’re guessing — and that gets expensive fast.
•	You don’t need to wait for a perfect product to launch.
What you need is a minimum version that actually teaches you something.
•	**Validated learning > vanity metrics.**
That means less dashboard worship and more honest user conversations.

⚖️ **What I Genuinely Liked**:
•	Ries writes like someone who’s been through failure — not just theorising from a whiteboard.
•	There are real, gritty examples. Not everything scaled. Not everything worked.
•	It made me rethink what “progress” looks like in the early stages — sometimes, progress is just removing what nobody needs.

🤔 **What Didn’t Fully Land**:
•	It leans heavily on tech startups. If you’re in hardware, services, or slower industries, not everything will map.
•	Some parts now feel a little dated — the language of early 2010s startup culture hasn’t aged perfectly.

📈 **Final Verdict**:
The Lean Startup doesn’t hype you up. It grounds you.
And sometimes, that’s more useful.
If you’re just getting started, this is required reading. If you’ve already started, it’s the mirror you might not want, but definitely need.

**Rating**: **4.6/5**
