After reading all the “scale fast or die” startup books, this one felt like an exhale.
Jarvis flips the script: what if growth isn’t the goal? What if freedom, sustainability, and focus are more valuable than headcount or VC rounds?
He’s not anti-business. He’s anti–blind-scaling.

💡 **Refreshing Ideas**:
•	Growth can be a trap — not all revenue is worth the cost.
•	Small teams = faster pivots, better control, lower overhead.
•	Success is personal — define it before you chase it.

❤️ **What's Insightful**:
•	Perfect for solopreneurs or bootstrapped founders.
•	Reminded me to audit my goals, not just my KPIs.
•	Great interviews with indie founders across industries.

🤔 **What's Soft**:
•	Lacks deep technical finance or systems thinking.
•	Won’t resonate with VC-backed founders aiming for blitzscale.

📈 **Verdict**:
Read this if you’re burnt out, bootstrapping, or questioning scale for the sake of it.
A grounded book in a noisy ecosystem.

**Rating**: **4.4/5**
