This book was like a conversation with someone who's seen the trenches and the top.
Tony Fadell helped build the iPod, the iPhone, and Nest — and Build is his uncensored, blunt, tactical guide to doing great product work, surviving toxic bosses, and managing your own ambition.

💡 **Key Punches**:
•	"Your idea is probably bad. Work on it anyway."
•	Great products come from **customer obsession**, not founder ego.
•	Learn to fire yourself — delegate before you burn out.

❤️ **What Works**:
•	Brutally honest — especially about startup burnout and product failures.
•	Structured like a reference guide: mentorship, hiring, roadmaps, ego management.
•	Doesn’t glorify hustle — just demands clarity.

🤔 **What's Intense**:
•	Reads like 100 direct messages in a row — can be overwhelming.
•	Less for first-time founders, more for product operators or scale-up leads.

📈 **Verdict**:
This book doesn’t waste your time.
If you’re in the building phase — read it, reread it, mark it up.

**Rating**: **4.8/5**
