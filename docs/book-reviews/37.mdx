You’ll never look at a $50 note the same way again.
This book traces the wild, weird history of money — from cowry shells to crypto — and asks a fundamental question: *What actually gives it value?*
Written by an NPR journalist, it’s breezy but surprisingly deep.

💡 **Eye Openers**:
•	Central banks used to be private ventures. Wild.
•	Money has always been a **story** backed by shared belief.
•	Crypto isn't as new as we think — it’s the latest chapter in centuries of evolution.

❤️ **What I Liked**:
•	Great mix of history, humor, and economic storytelling.
•	Helped me explain inflation, fiat currency, and digital money better.
•	No jargon — just clarity.

🤔 **What's It's Not**:
•	Doesn’t go deep on current DeFi or technical finance.
•	More narrative than tactical.

📈 **Verdict**:
If you like money but don’t love economics textbooks, this is your gateway drug.
A sharp, fun look at how this whole “money” thing works.

**Rating**: **4.4/5**
