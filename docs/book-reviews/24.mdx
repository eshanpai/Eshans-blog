Classic. A bit old-school, but still packed with gold.
Brian Tracy breaks down the mechanics of what makes people buy — not just logically, but emotionally. He blends mindset and tactics, showing how belief in your product (and yourself) drives every successful pitch.
Even if you’re not in sales, you are.
Everyone’s selling — an idea, a vision, a story.

💡 **Sales Psychology Highlights**:
•	People don’t buy products. They buy **feelings** — status, relief, confidence.
•	Repetition builds belief — in both the buyer and seller.
•	Ask questions, listen more, and anchor the emotional value before price.

❤️ **What Still Works**:
•	Ideal for founders pitching, job seekers, or even content creators.
•	Reinforces how mindset shapes tone and tone shapes outcomes.
•	Made me rewrite how I introduce my startup.

🤔 **What Feels Outdated**:
•	The examples and references feel very ‘90s — think car lots and cold calls.
•	Some gendered assumptions in buyer behavior haven’t aged well.

📈 **Verdict**:
If you approach this with a modern filter, the principles still land hard.
It’s less about closing — more about connecting.

**Rating**: **4.3/5**
