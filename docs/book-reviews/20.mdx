Written by the founder of Gumroad, this book is a counter-pitch to startup hype.
No unicorns. No 10x exits. Just **real, profitable** businesses built by small teams solving real problems.
Lavingia argues that you don’t need VC funding, media buzz, or 100-hour weeks. You just need focus, community, and sustainable growth.

💡 **What I Took Away**:
•	Build in public. Share your journey early.
•	Profit isn’t a dirty word — it’s freedom.
•	Start small, with a niche audience, and grow sideways.

❤️ **What I Loved**:
•	Honest — even about his own failures.
•	Encouraging for solo founders or indie hackers.
•	Short and to the point. You could finish it in a day.

🤔 **What's Limited**:
•	Some parts feel like expanded tweets.
•	Not for folks chasing massive scale.

📈 **Verdict**:
You don’t have to build big. You just have to build well.

**Rating**: **4.4/5**
