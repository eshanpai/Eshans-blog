Ramit Sethi doesn’t sugarcoat things. He writes like a financially savvy older brother who’s slightly annoyed you’re still using a debit card.
This book isn’t about penny-pinching or spreadsheets. It’s about **automating your money**, spending on what you love, and guilt-free wealth.

💡 **Big Wins > Small Sacrifices**:
•	Focus on things that actually move the needle: investing, debt, big expenses.
•	Automate your savings and investments so you don’t think about them.
•	Don’t feel guilty about lattes. Feel guilty about inaction.

❤️ **What Hit Home**:
•	Ramit’s scripts for negotiating fees and raises are gold.
•	The tone is confident without being condescending.
•	It’s aggressively practical — you can take action after chapter one.

🤔 **What I Skipped**:
•	Some of the humour felt forced, especially if you’re outside the U.S.
•	Not all banking and credit info applies in Australia or India.

📈 **Final Verdict**:
This is the financial kick in the teeth that most people in their 20s need.
Actionable, honest, and refreshingly modern.

**Rating**: **4.6/5**
