🧠 **Business Model (Expanded)**
NAB is one of Australia’s Big Four banks, with core operations across:
•	Retail banking
•	Business and SME lending
•	Institutional finance
•	Agribusiness (unique niche)

💰 **Financials (FY23)**
•	Net Profit: AUD $7.7B
•	Net Interest Margin: ~1.8%
•	CET1: ~12.2%

🧩 **Strategy (Expanded)**
•	Digital transformation (Ubank, mobile-first)
•	SME focus vs peers’ mortgage obsession
•	Partnerships with fintechs & startup accelerators

⚠️ **Risks**
•	Mortgage competition from neobanks
•	Housing market sensitivity
•	Limited global presence vs Macquarie

🧠 **Founder POV**
NAB proves that you can be big and still build for the little guy — if you stay sharp on product.

⚖️ **Takeaway**
Size matters less than clarity of focus.
