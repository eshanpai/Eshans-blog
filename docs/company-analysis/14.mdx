🧠 **Business Model (Expanded)**
Bharti Airtel is India’s second-largest telecom provider and a rising leader in digital infrastructure. It operates across:
•	Mobile (prepaid & postpaid)
•	Broadband (Airtel Xstream)
•	Enterprise B2B (IoT, Cloud)
•	Payments & banking (Airtel Payments Bank)
It generates revenue via ARPU (average revenue per user), data usage, and enterprise contracts.

💰 **Financials (FY23–24)**
•	Revenue: ₹145,000 crore
•	Net Profit: ₹11,000 crore
•	ARPU: ₹200+
•	Subscribers: 370M+

🧩 **Strategy (Expanded)**
•	Aggressive 5G rollout
•	Monetizing non-core verticals (e.g., Nxtra data centers)
•	Africa business contributes ~30% of revenue
•	High focus on digital services bundling (OTT, payments, gaming)

⚠️ **Risks**
•	Capex-heavy due to 5G infrastructure
•	Pricing wars if Jio undercuts again
•	Regulatory headwinds in telecom

🧠 **Founder POV**
Airtel learned the hard way that telecom is a game of both speed and survival. Now it’s back — with data pipes and digital bundling.

⚖️ **Takeaway**
Distribution isn’t enough. You need infrastructure too.
