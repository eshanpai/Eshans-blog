🧠 **Business Model (Expanded)**
Canva democratized design. It runs a freemium SaaS model, offering:
•	Design tools for social media, presentations, docs
•	Team collaboration tools
•	B2B enterprise suite (Canva for Teams, Whiteboards)
•	Marketplace: Templates, photos, plugins

💰 **Financials (Est. FY24)**
•	Revenue: ~$2.2B
•	Profitability: Cashflow-positive since 2017
•	150M+ monthly active users

🧩 **Strategy (Expanded)**
•	Massive school + nonprofit adoption
•	Integrations with Microsoft, Google Workspace, Zoom
•	Growing Canva Docs as Google Docs alternative

⚠️ **Risks**
•	Adobe competition (Firefly, Express)
•	Generative AI eroding entry-level design use cases
•	High dependency on North America + education segments

🧠 **Founder POV**
Canva isn’t just a design tool. It’s how millions learned they could be creative.

⚖️ **Takeaway**
Build tools for what people do every day — and you build habits, not just users.
