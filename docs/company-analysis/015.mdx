🧠 **Business Model (Expanded)**
PayPal is one of the original internet-era fintechs, now evolving into a super-app for payments and merchant services.
•	Core: Transaction fees on P2P & merchant payments
•	Subsidiaries: Venmo, Braintree, Xoom, Honey
•	Services: Pay Later, crypto, rewards, checkout SDKs

💰 **Financials (FY23)**
•	Revenue: $29B
•	Net Income: $4.2B
•	Total Payment Volume: $1.5T
•	Active Accounts: 430M

🧩 **Strategy (Expanded)**
•	Diversifying revenue beyond core checkout
•	Buy-now-pay-later push with PayPal Credit
•	Heavy competition from Stripe, Apple Pay, Shopify

⚠️ **Risks**
•	Declining market share in key geographies
•	Overlap with emerging neobanks
•	Limited success in merchant lending

🧠 **Founder POV**
PayPal was once a fintech rebel. Now it risks becoming the bank it disrupted.

⚖️ **Takeaway**
Innovate like a startup — even if you're public.
