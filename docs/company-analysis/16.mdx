💰 **Financials (FY23–24)**

🧩 **Strategy (Expanded)**
•	Aggressive infra expansion (13 airports, 2 data parks)
•	Bet on India’s energy transition (solar, hydrogen)
•	Political-adjacent capital access = speed advantage

⚠️ **Risks**

🧠 **Founder POV**
Adani’s empire was built not just on ambition, but on execution speed — and daring bets where few dared to look.
