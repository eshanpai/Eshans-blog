title: "How $46 Taught Me More Than a Finance Degree"

Back when I first moved to Australia, I had $46 left after rent and groceries.
No car, no meal plan, no Uber Eats. Just a weekly Myki pass and pure improvisation.
And that week taught me more than any finance class:
I learned how to prioritise (coffee > Wi-Fi)
I learned what’s “need” vs “nice”
I learned how powerful it feels to know where your money’s going
You don’t need a high income to learn money.
You just need a week where every dollar counts.
That was the week I realised:
Finance isn’t complicated.
It’s just never been explained like this before.
