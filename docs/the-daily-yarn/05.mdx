The Money Yarn â€” This Week in Aussie & Indian Fintech
 Pull up a chair. Hereâ€™s what went down in the world of startups, bills, and big money moves.
â¸»

**Australia:**
Xero slims down: The accounting giant is cutting 700+ jobs. Efficiency isnâ€™t a buzzword anymore â€” itâ€™s survival. SaaS margins are under the microscope, and even the big dogs are trimming fat.

Tap & go goes deeper: New data shows over 96% of point-of-sale payments in Aus are now contactless. QR might be the future, but in Australia, it has to be instant, effortless, and addictive to compete.

Treasury eyes 'PayTo' expansion: Australia's real-time debit system is gaining traction. It's not just for subscriptions anymore â€” the goal is to take a bite out of Visa & Mastercard's lunch.
â¸»
**India:**
Paytmâ€™s pause: The RBI crackdown fallout continues â€” Paytm Payments Bank has halted most operations. Reminder: regulation is no longer a postscript â€” itâ€™s the whole script.

Cred lands another punch: Kunal Shahâ€™s Cred has quietly crossed 20M users. It's not just about credit card payments anymore â€” theyâ€™re building a full-stack wealth & bill ecosystem for urban India.

UPI goes global (again): After UAE, Sri Lanka and Mauritius â€” UPI is now set to expand into France. Scan-and-pay, made in India, exported with pride.
â¸»
ðŸŽ¯ **Bonus Byte:**
 Klarna just dropped a new AI-powered shopping assistant built entirely on OpenAI.
 
 From BNPL to BFF â€” fintech is blending hard money flows with soft UX.
 
 Meanwhile, in Sydney and Mumbai, founders are just trying to make their apps not crash during checkout.
Progress is layered â€” but the momentumâ€™s real.
â¸»
Whether youâ€™re debugging your next payment flow or sipping chai over tax returns â€” remember: moneyâ€™s messy, but it tells the best stories.

Catch ya next Sunday.
