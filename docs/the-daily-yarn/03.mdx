The Money Yarn — This Week in Aussie & Indian Fintech
Pull up a chair. Here’s what went down in the world of startups, bills, and big money moves.

**Australia:**
RBA chills… for now: No fresh rate hikes, but inflation’s still lurking like a drop bear. Keep your umbrella — and your emergency fund — handy.

Xero’s trimming the guest list: The accounting giant’s focusing on premium customers. Translation: if you’re not wearing cufflinks, you might not get served.

Aussies chase the sun: Solar installs are smashing records. Looks like we’ve all had enough of energy bills that bite harder than a magpie in spring.

**India:**
LIC goes digital (finally): India’s insurance mammoth is going full fintech. Took a while, but hey — even dinosaurs can dance with the right beat.

Zomato’s Blinkit blitz: Blinkit might just be the jewel in Zomato’s crown. 10-minute delivery is their new love language — let’s hope investors feel the spark.

Paytm’s rocky road: Trust has taken a hit post-RBI restrictions. It’s not easy being a fintech hero when the regulator hits pause mid-scene.


Whether you’re saving for your next chai latte or scaling your side hustle — stay sharp, stay curious, and don’t let the bills boss you around.

Catch ya next Sunday.
