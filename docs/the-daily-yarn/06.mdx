title: "The 3 Types of Broke (and how to avoid the worst one)"

import styles from '@site/src/css/preserve.module.css';

We throw around the word “broke,” but let’s break it down:

Flat broke: Zero in the bank. You’re surviving, not living.
Fake broke: You’ve got money but act broke — often the savviest people.
Future broke: You look fine now… but it’s all borrowed. Credit cards, BNPL, EMIs.

Future broke is the sneakiest one.

Because debt delays pain.
But when it hits, it hits all at once — with interest.

Tip:
Before you spend, ask:
“Is this my money… or my future’s problem?”
