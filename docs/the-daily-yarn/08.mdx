import styles from '@site/src/css/preserve.module.css';

<div className={styles.preserve}>

They don’t work the most hours.
They don’t tick every task.
They just ask better questions.
 • What breaks if we don’t do this?
 • What’s the upside if it works?
 • Who owns this, and what’s the risk?

If you want a board seat one day, stop thinking like an employee.
Start thinking like a system.
