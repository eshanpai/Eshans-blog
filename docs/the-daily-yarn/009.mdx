“That’s how it’s always been done” is how companies die

Every boardroom mistake starts with a whisper:

“We’ve always done it this way.”

That mindset:
 • Killed Blockbuster
 • Let Kodak miss digital
 • Delayed banks from reinventing themselves

If you want to sit at the table where real decisions are made,
Start by being the person who isn’t afraid to ask:

“What if we’re wrong?”
