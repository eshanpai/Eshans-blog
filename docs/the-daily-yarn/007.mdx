If you don’t know what your role pays in the market — you’re leaving money on the table.

Here’s how to check:
 • Search roles like yours on Glassdoor or LinkedIn Salaries
 • Hop on Reddit (r/ausfinance or r/careerguidance)
 • Talk to ex-employees, peers, recruiters
 • Compare titles, locations, and benefits — not just base pay

Why this matters:
Your biggest raise often doesn’t come from your boss.
It comes from knowing what you’re worth before the negotiation.

Knowledge is leverage.
Leverage is money
