When I first moved to Australia, I wasn’t broke — but I was definitely on the edge.

After paying rent and groceries one week, I had exactly $46 left in my account.
No meal plan. No Uber Eats. No backup.

Just a weekly Myki pass, 6 days to survive, and one big reality check.

🎯 The Week I Learned What Matters
It’s funny — I had studied finance. I knew balance sheets, discounted cash flow, and how to read a P&L.

But this wasn’t theory. This was real.

With $46, you start looking at everything differently:

Coffee or Wi-Fi? I picked coffee. The library gave me internet for free.

Snacks or savings? Neither. I learned to eat at home.

Impulse buys? You realise very quickly what’s “need” vs “nice.”

Every dollar was a decision.
Every swipe made me pause.

💡 What That Week Taught Me
That week taught me more than any finance class ever did:

I learned that knowing where your money goes is more powerful than earning more of it.

I learned that discipline isn’t about denial — it’s about direction.

I learned that when your budget is tight, your values get real clear, real fast.

Most importantly, I realised:

Finance isn’t complicated.
It’s just never been explained like a real person lives it.

📌 Why I’m Telling You This
Because money has become a performance.
Buzzwords. Charts. A game where only the experts win.

But that $46 week made me believe there’s another way —
where money can be simple, story-led, and honest.

That week became the seed for everything I’m building now.
It’s why The Money Yarn exists.
It’s why I’m building Strayapay.

And maybe — just maybe — your lowest balance week is actually your richest one.

🤔 Ever had a “$46 moment”?
A week that rewired how you saw money?
Drop me a note. I’d love to hear your yarn.
