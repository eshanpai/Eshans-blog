By the time an opportunity looks “safe,”
everyone’s already standing in line.

Startups. Markets. Careers.
The real wins happen when it still feels slightly insane.

If you want outsized returns,
you have to place uncomfortable bets — early.

Consensus makes you average.
Conviction makes you wealthy.
