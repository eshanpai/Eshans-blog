Pull up a chair. Itâ€™s time to untangle what happened in the world of finance, founders, and fearless pivots.

Google Pay eyes Indian SMEs: Google Pay is rolling out new tools for small businesses in India â€” invoices, credit lines, and loyalty programs. Big Tech is officially playing SME fintech catch-up.

Stripe quietly building for UPI: Stripe is working behind the scenes to roll out UPI acceptance for Indian merchants.

Global fintechs arenâ€™t just watching â€” theyâ€™re adapting to the India playbook.

If you canâ€™t beat UPI, you join it.

Meanwhile, somewhere in a Melbourne cafÃ©, a founder is sketching a new payments app on a napkin â€” dreaming of building the next big thing before the barista calls out their flat white.
