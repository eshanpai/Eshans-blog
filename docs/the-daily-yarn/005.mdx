title: "The Scam Called “Lifestyle Inflation"

Got a raise? Awesome.
Now suddenly it’s oat lattes, Uber Premium, and new AirPods — all justified with “I work hard, I deserve this.”

That’s lifestyle inflation.

What it means:
Your spending grows as your income does.
But your savings? They don’t move.

Why it’s dangerous:
 • It feels normal.
 • It’s socially accepted.
 • And it keeps you from building real wealth.

The fix?
Upgrade your lifestyle after you upgrade your savings.
Otherwise, you’ll always feel “broke” — no matter your salary.
