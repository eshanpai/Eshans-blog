<div className={styles.preserve}>

You can’t hire your way out of chaos.
You can’t rely on “rockstars” forever.
Even Messi needs a midfield.

If your business depends on brilliant individuals showing up 100% every day, it’s already broken.
Great founders build systems — then slot good people into great frameworks.

Talent shines.
Systems endure.
