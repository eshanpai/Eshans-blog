<div className={styles.preserve}>

Founders: Aadit Palicha & Kaivalya Vohra
Founded: 2021
Headquarters: Mumbai
Category: Quick Commerce (Q-Commerce)
Valuation: ~$1.4 billion (as of 2023)
Status: Unicorn
Tagline: “Groceries delivered in 10 minutes.”

🚀 What It Does:
Zepto promises 10-minute delivery of groceries and essentials via a dense network of dark stores (micro-warehouses) across urban India. It operates in major cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, and Chennai.

Think: Blinkit speed with Swiggy Instamart-like inventory — but executed by a logistics-obsessed Gen Z team.

💡 Why It Works:
Hyperlocal dark stores within 1.5–2 km of delivery zones

AI-led route + inventory optimization

High urban demand, dense traffic zones

A young, aggressive team scaling at breakneck speed

💰 Funding & Investors:
Raised $550M+ across Series A–E

Investors: Y Combinator, Nexus VP, Glade Brook, Lachy Groom, Goodwater Capital

Reached unicorn status in just 18 months — one of India's fastest

📈 Traction & Metrics:
~300K orders/day (2023 peak)

Positive unit economics reported in select dark stores

Operating in 10+ cities

Investing in private labels to boost margins

🧠 Strategy Snapshot:
Core strength: Execution + Speed

Focused on groceries, personal care, snacks, daily needs

Gradual expansion into non-grocery high-margin categories

Preparing for IPO readiness with cost discipline

⚠️ Challenges:
Thin delivery margins + high burn rate

Growing competition from Blinkit (Zomato), Instamart (Swiggy)

Labour conditions, delivery partner safety, and customer retention pressure

High dependency on venture capital for now

🔮 What’s Next:
Launching more private labels

Testing larger SKUs like electronics and wellness

Exploring IPO path within 2–3 years

Pushing into event-based commerce (e.g. IPL nights, party packs)
